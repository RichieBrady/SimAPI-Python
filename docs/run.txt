To produce and simulate an FMU navigate to "src/simapi_simulation/" this is where the docker-compose.yml is located
along with two Dockerfile located in fmu_generator and fmu_simulator, each Dockerfile builds a container
with the specifications to enable generating an fmu, and simulating the fmu.

Run "docker-compose build"
This will take a few minutes as the containers need to download and install dependencies

On successful build
run "docker-compose up"

The fmu is produced by a Dockerfile script located in "src/simapi_simulation/fmu_generator/"

Output from the container is placed in a shared volume located at "src/simapi_simulation/fmu_simulator/volume/"

"src/simapi_simulation/fmu_simulator/volume" contains the pyFMI script that will run the fmu simulation.

When the simulation is successfully run, output files will be generated in "src/simapi_simulation/fmu_simulator/volume"

outputs.txt is generated by the pyFMI script and are the fmu output values at each timestep, res.txt is the time in
seconds at each timestep.
